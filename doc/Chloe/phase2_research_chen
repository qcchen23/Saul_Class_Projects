Project Phase Two – Research

For the Spatial Role Labeling project, researchers have used machine learning to solve it. Spatial relations are defined
as relations between objects, whereas the object that takes the central role in the relationship is called trajector,
and the secondary object that complements the relationship is called the landmark. A static spatial relation is defined
as a tuple that contains a trajector, a landmark and a spatial indicator.

Researchers made five different tasks for the machine – to identify types of spatial annotations, to identify tuples
that connect spatial indicators identified, to identify markable spans for spatial annotations, to identify n-tuples
that connect spatial markables identified, and to identify the semantics of spatial relationships. In the first and
third tasks, roles are labeled by a sequence-based classifier. In the second task, all roles found from the first
task are combined to generate candidate relations, which are verified by a Support Vector Machine classifier. A
convolution kernel is used to measure the similarity between syntactic structures. The overall results of previous
research show that machine learning models can learn from annotated data to extract spatial roles and relations.
I think for future objectives, we can try to make the model applicable to a wider range of data.
